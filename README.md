# Solitaire Solver

An intelligent automated program for playing and solving Klondike Solitaire games through computer vision and artificial intelligence.

## Overview

This project combines computer vision, OCR, and heuristic algorithms to automatically detect, analyze, and solve Klondike Solitaire games. The solver can process images of Solitaire games, recognize cards, and execute optimal moves to reach a solution.


## Key Features

### 🎮 Game Solving Engine
- Advanced heuristic-based solver for determining optimal moves
- Priority-based decision making that considers:
  - Maximizing empty tableau spaces
  - Uncovering face-down cards
  - Building foundation sequences

### 🔍 Computer Vision System
- **Robust Card Detection**
  - Advanced contour detection for identifying card boundaries
  - Precise location and orientation recognition
  - Support for overlapping and partially visible cards
  
- **Accurate Card Recognition**
  - Suit classification using ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature matching
  - Value recognition through Tesseract OCR integration
  - Support for all standard playing cards (A, 2-10, J, Q, K)

### 🤖 Automation
- Seamless game interaction through PyAutoGUI
- Automated mouse movement and clicking for card manipulation
- Real-time move execution based on solver decisions


**Limitations:** The heuristic-based solver works well for most Solitaire setups but does not guarantee the optimal solution or solve every game, particularly in more complex configurations. The card recognition accuracy depends on the quality of the input image and the clarity of the cards.

     brew install tesseract
     ```

## Usage

1. Open your favorite Solitaire game.
2. Run the solver:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. Use the selection tool to select the game board region.
4. The program will automatically solve the game!

## Debug Visualization
This project also includes a built-in debugger for each computer vision step, allowing you to visualize card detection and recognition in real-time.
